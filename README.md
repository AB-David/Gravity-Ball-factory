# MIT xPro Project ðŸ’»
This is one of the projects I was working on to get my professional certificate in Full Stack Development by MIT xPro. 
If you are curious about this rigorous program you can learn more about it [here](https://youtu.be/5CiCtj_2Qsg).

## Ball factory
This will create any number of balls in different colors, then bounce them within a defined area while taking gravity into consideration.

# *Demo*
![demo](https://bit.ly/3t3hi1M)

### *Usage*: 
1. Open the IDE 
2. Enter the number of balls you'd like to simulate in the factory function. 
	* For example for 15 balls, the input should be: factory(15)
3. To update the balls velocity, type: update()

### *Roadmap*
Next version will simulate the movement of multiple Covid-19 particles after a sneeze, while taking gravity into consideration.
