# MIT xPro Project 💻
This is one of the projects I was working on to get my professional certificate in Full Stack Development by MIT xPro. 
If you are curious about this rigorous program you can learn more about it [here](https://youtu.be/5CiCtj_2Qsg).

## Ball factory
This will create any number of balls in different colors, then bounce them within a defined area while taking gravity into consideration.

# *Demo*
![demo](https://bit.ly/3t3hi1M)

### *Usage*: 
1. Open the file then the IDE 
2. Enter the number of balls you'd like to simulate as arguments in the function factory. 
	* For example for 15 balls the input should be: factory(15)
3. It is also possible to update the balls velocity, to do that type: update()

### *Roadmap*
Next version will simulate the movement of Covid-19 particles after sneezing while taking gravity into consideration.
